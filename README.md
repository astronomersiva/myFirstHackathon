# myFirstHackathon

My friend Akash and I participated in the hackathon organised by the Madras Institute of Technology. We were asked to develop an
app for Firefox OS.

We built a transit details provider. We have used Google Maps API as it was the only one to provide transit details.
I am now considering building a scraper in Python to extract bus details from Chennai MTC's website and add it to 
a localised DB in the future versions.
